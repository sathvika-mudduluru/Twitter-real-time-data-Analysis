# Twitter-real-time-data-Analysis

We used the Real-Time Data Processing Twitter API from https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/stream-tweets-in-real-time for this big data project. Prior to examining the Kafka server, we must first confirm that the Zookeeper server is operational. We started by creating a topic in Jupyter Notebook using Apache Kafka, and with the assistance of the producer and consumers, we produced the subject for subscribers. Next, we developed DStreams to store and process real-time Twitter data using Dstreams operations.
